        "\n",
        "File handling in Python refers to the process of working with files on your computer's file system. This includes tasks such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Reading from files:** Accessing the content of a file.\n",
        "*   **Writing to files:** Saving data to a file.\n",
        "*   **Creating new files:** Generating new files on your system.\n",
        "*   **Deleting files:** Removing files from your system.\n",
        "*   **Manipulating file metadata:** Changing information about a file, such as its name or permissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "File handling is essential for many programming tasks, including data storage, configuration settings, logging, and processing external data sources. Python provides built-in functions and modules that make it easy to interact with files in various formats, such as text files, binary files, CSV files, and more."

        "\n",
        "Reading from files is a fundamental operation in programming, especially when you need to load data that has been saved. In the context of a game, this is how you would typically load saved game states, configuration settings, or, as you mentioned, high scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general process for reading a file in Python involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Opening the file:** You use the `open()` function, specifying the file path and the mode (`'r'` for reading).\n",
        "2.  **Reading the data:** You can read the entire file at once (`read()`), line by line (`readline()`), or all lines into a list (`readlines()`).\n",
        "3.  **Processing the data:** Once the data is read, you'll need to parse and process it according to its format (e.g., converting strings to numbers, splitting lines into individual scores).\n",
        "4.  **Closing the file:** It's good practice to close the file when you're done, although using `with open(...) as file:` handles this automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "For reading high scores, you would open the file where they are stored, read the content, and then process each line or entry to get the individual scores. You might then sort them or display the top ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a code example that demonstrates reading from a file named `high_scores.txt`. We'll assume each line in this file contains a single high score."

        "**Exception handling** in Python is a mechanism that allows you to gracefully deal with errors that occur during the execution of your program. These errors, called **exceptions**, disrupt the normal flow of the program's instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this: when an unexpected situation arises that the program doesn't know how to handle in its regular flow (like trying to divide by zero, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist), an exception is \"raised\". If this exception isn't caught and handled, the program will crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling allows you to:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Catch** these exceptions when they occur.\n",
        "*   **Handle** them in a way that prevents your program from crashing.\n",
        "*   **Provide informative messages** to the user or log the error for debugging.\n",
        "*   **Clean up resources**, even if errors occur (like ensuring a file is closed).\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary constructs for exception handling in Python are the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`try`**: This block contains the code that might potentially raise an exception.\n",
        "*   **`except`**: If an exception occurs in the `try` block, the code in the `except` block is executed. You can specify different `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
        "*   **`else`**: The code in the `else` block is executed if the `try` block completes without raising any exceptions.\n",
        "*   **`finally`**: The code in the `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This is often used for cleanup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using exception handling makes your programs more robust and reliable, as they can anticipate and respond to unexpected situations instead of simply failing."
