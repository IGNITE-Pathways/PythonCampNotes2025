So far, we've seen functions that take one parameter or no parameters. However, functions can be much more flexible!\n\n### Functions with Multiple Parameters\n\nYou can define functions that accept more than one input value, called parameters. These parameters are specified within the parentheses after the function name, separated by commas.\n\nWhen you call the function, you provide values for each parameter, called arguments, in the same order as defined in the function signature.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name, greeting):\n  \"\"\"Greets a person with a personalized message.\"\"\"\n  print(f\"{greeting}, {name}!\")\n\n# Calling the function with multiple arguments\ngreet(\"Alice\", \"Hello\")\ngreet(\"Bob\", \"Good morning\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `greet` function takes two parameters: `name` and `greeting`. When we call `greet(\"Alice\", \"Hello\")`, \"Alice\" is assigned to `name` and \"Hello\" is assigned to `greeting`.\n\n### Functions Returning Multiple Values\n\nSometimes, a function needs to return more than one piece of information. In Python, functions can return multiple values by packing them into a tuple. A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items.\n\nWhen you call a function that returns a tuple, you can unpack the values into separate variables.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ndef get_circle_properties(radius):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the circumference and area of a circle.\"\"\"\n  pi = 3.14159\n  circumference = 2 * pi * radius\n  area = pi * radius**2\n  return circumference, area # Returns a tuple\n\n# Calling the function and unpacking the returned tuple\nradius = 5\ncirc, ar = get_circle_properties(radius)\n\nprint(f\"For a circle with radius {radius}:\")\nprint(f\"Circumference: {circ:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Area: {ar:.2f}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `get_circle_properties` function calculates both the circumference and area and returns them as a tuple `(circumference, area)`. When we call `circ, ar = get_circle_properties(radius)`, the first element of the tuple (circumference) is assigned to `circ`, and the second element (area) is assigned to `ar`.\n"

        "\n",
        "### Project Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Text-Based Interface:** The game will run in the console. Use `print()` to display the game state (like the grid, player position, and item positions) and `input()` to get player commands (e.g., move left or right).\n",
        "*   **Game Space:** Represent the game area as a 1D space (a line) or a simple 2D grid. A 1D space is simpler to start with.\n",
        "*   **Player Movement:** The player character should be able to move left and right within the game space boundaries based on player input.\n",
        "*   **Item Generation and Movement:** Items should appear periodically at one end of the game space and move towards the other end over time. You'll need to manage multiple items potentially.\n",
        "*   **Collision Detection:** Implement logic to detect when the player's position matches an item's position, signifying that the item has been \"caught\".\n",
        "*   **Scoring:** Keep track of the number of items the player catches.\n",
        "*   **Game End:** The game should end after a certain condition is met, such as a fixed number of items appearing or the player missing too many items.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Use the Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Functions with Multiple Parameters/Return Values:**\n",
        "    *   Create a function `move_player(current_pos, direction, max_pos)` that takes the player's current position, the desired direction (left/right), and the boundary of the game space, and returns the player's new, valid position.\n",
        "    *   Create a function `generate_item(game_parameters)` that might take parameters about the game state (like the width of the game space) and return the starting position of a new item.\n",
        "*   **More List Operations (append, remove):**\n",
        "    *   Use a list (e.g., `item_positions`) to store the current positions of all falling items.\n",
        "    *   Use `append()` to add the position of a newly generated item to the list.\n",
        "    *   Use `remove()` to remove an item's position from the list when it is caught or when it goes off the screen (missed).\n",
        "*   **Intro to Collision Detection Logic:**\n",
        "    *   Inside your game loop, iterate through the list of `item_positions`.\n",
        "    *   For each item's position, check if it is equal to the player's current position (`if item_pos == player_pos:`). If they match, a collision (catch) has occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think about structuring your game using a main game loop that repeatedly:\n",
        "1.  Displays the current state of the game.\n",
        "2.  Gets player input.\n",
        "3.  Updates the player's position.\n",
        "4.  Updates the positions of all items.\n",
        "5.  Checks for collisions and updates the score/removes caught items.\n",
        "6.  Generates new items occasionally.\n",
        "7.  Checks for game-end conditions.\n",
        "\n",

It modifies the list in place and does not return a new list.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```python\n# Starting with a list\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nprint(f\"Original list: {fruits}\")\n\n# Appending a new element\nfruits.append(\"date\")\nprint(f\"List after appending 'date': {fruits}\")\n\n# Appending another element\nfruits.append(\"elderberry\")\nprint(f\"List after appending 'elderberry': {fruits}\")\n```\n\nAs you can see, each time `append()` is called, the new element is added to the end of the `fruits` list.\n\n### Removing Elements with `remove()`\n\nThe `remove()` method allows you to remove the *first* occurrence of a specific value from a list. If the value is not found in the list, it will raise a `ValueError`. Like `append()`, `remove()` modifies the list in place.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\n# Starting with a list (with a repeated element)\ncolors = [\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"yellow\"]\nprint(f\"Original list: {colors}\")\n\n# Removing the first occurrence of 'blue'\ncolors.remove(\"blue\")\nprint(f\"List after removing the first 'blue': {colors}\")\n\n# Removing 'red'\ncolors.remove(\"red\")\nprint(f\"List after removing 'red': {colors}\")\n\n# If you try to remove an element that's not there, you'll get an error:\n# colors.remove(\"purple\") # Uncommenting this line would cause a ValueError\n```\n\nThe `remove()` method is useful when you know the value you want to remove. Remember, it only removes the first match it finds.\n"

So far, we've seen functions that take one parameter or no parameters. However, functions can be much more flexible!\n\n### Functions with Multiple Parameters\n\nYou can define functions that accept more than one input value, called parameters. These parameters are specified within the parentheses after the function name, separated by commas.\n\nWhen you call the function, you provide values for each parameter, called arguments, in the same order as defined in the function signature.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ndef greet(name, greeting):\n  \"\"\"Greets a person with a personalized message.\"\"\"\n  print(f\"{greeting}, {name}!\")\n\n# Calling the function with multiple arguments\ngreet(\"Alice\", \"Hello\")\ngreet(\"Bob\", \"Good morning\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `greet` function takes two parameters: `name` and `greeting`. When we call `greet(\"Alice\", \"Hello\")`, \"Alice\" is assigned to `name` and \"Hello\" is assigned to `greeting`.\n\n### Functions Returning Multiple Values\n\nSometimes, a function needs to return more than one piece of information. In Python, functions can return multiple values by packing them into a tuple. A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of items.\n\nWhen you call a function that returns a tuple, you can unpack the values into separate variables.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ndef get_circle_properties(radius):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the circumference and area of a circle.\"\"\"\n  pi = 3.14159\n  circumference = 2 * pi * radius\n  area = pi * radius**2\n  return circumference, area # Returns a tuple\n\n# Calling the function and unpacking the returned tuple\nradius = 5\ncirc, ar = get_circle_properties(radius)\n\nprint(f\"For a circle with radius {radius}:\")\nprint(f\"Circumference: {circ:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Area: {ar:.2f}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `get_circle_properties` function calculates both the circumference and area and returns them as a tuple `(circumference, area)`. When we call `circ, ar = get_circle_properties(radius)`, the first element of the tuple (circumference) is assigned to `circ`, and the second element (area) is assigned to `ar`.\n"
